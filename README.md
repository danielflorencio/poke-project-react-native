# React Native PokeAPI Mobile Application

This is a mobile application built using React Native, TypeScript, Expo, and Native Base. It connects to the PokeAPI, a free open-source API, to retrieve and display Pokémon data. The application allows users to view a list of Pokémon, search for specific Pokémon by name or ID, and view detailed information about each Pokémon.

**Note: There is also a web version of this project available in React. [Click here](https://github.com/danielflorencio/pokedex-project-web) to check it out.**

## Features

- List View: The application displays a list of Pokémons on the home screen, showing their names, IDs, and images.

- Search: Users can search for Pokémon by name or ID using the search bar.

- Pokémon Details: Tapping on a Pokémon from the list or search results opens a detailed view that shows additional information about the selected Pokémon, such as its abilities, characteristics, and stats.
